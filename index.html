		Hi, I'm Martin. There is no ryhme or reason about the things I love to do on my free time. I love going to the beach in the caribbean. Nothing resembles peace like a white sandy beach and blue ocean at your feet. As far as indoor fun, I play pool just about everyday. But when I am not on my free time, my time is dedicated to you, the client in developing your websites. The listed techonologies are tools I come to enjoy working with and help websites take on their own life.I am always looking for the boldest color pallete during design while putting togeher the most dynamically responsive page. Click the link below and leave me a message about what you are looking for in your website.</p>
